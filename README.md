Directory Mapping
-----------------
**Use:**
This script asks the user for a root directory to search through.

Once you specify a directory, the script walks through all the subfolders and lists all the files.
At the start you will be prompted if you want to look for a specific type of file (ex: .docx).
To find all files simply press [Enter] at the prompt.

The results saved to a csv file in the working directory.
