Directory Mapping
-----------------
Dir_map.py

**Use:**
This script asks the user for a root directory to search through.

Once you specify a directory, the script walks through all the subfolders and lists all the files.
At the start you will be prompted if you want to look for a specific type of file (ex: .docx).
To find all files simply press [Enter] at the prompt.

The results saved to a csv file in the working directory.

The easiest way to copy a file path in Windows is to navigate to the folder, SHIFT+Right-Click the folder, and select 'Copy as Path'

This will copy the directory to the clipboard with double quotes around the path. This can be pasted into the script at the prompt.
